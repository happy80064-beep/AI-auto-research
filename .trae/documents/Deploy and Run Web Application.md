Based on the project structure (React + Vite), here is the plan to deploy and run the application locally:

## 1. Install Dependencies
Run `npm install` to download and install all required libraries defined in `package.json`.

## 2. Start Development Server
Run `npm run dev` to start the local web server.

## 3. Verify & Preview
Once the server is running, I will provide you with the preview URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) so you can open it in your browser.

**Note:**
The `.env.local` file currently contains a placeholder for `GEMINI_API_KEY`. The application may require a valid API key to function correctly. You can update this file later if needed.
